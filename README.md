# Based Summer

Based Summer is a solo project created for the Buildathon Onchain Summer under the category:

**SOCIAL with Farcaster**

**Social Track**

## Purpose

The project aims to maximize the abstraction of blockchain and crypto by implementing the Coinbase Smart Wallet. Users can seamlessly create a wallet on-the-fly using a device as a keypass, making the experience as user-friendly as possible.

## Objective

The primary goal is to mint free stunning artwork created by the renowned artist [mochiNFT](https://twitter.com/mochiNFT), reflecting the positive vibes of Onchain Summer.

### NFT Details

- **Total Editions:** 33
  - **Fragmented Illustrations:** 3 (10 editions each)
  - **Individual Scenes:** 30 (300 editions each)

The total supply is 9,030 NFTs. Followers were asked to drop their PFPs without permission for inclusion in the illustration, which also features memes and notable figures.

## Minting Process

Minting can be done for free, sponsored by the Coinbase Paymaster (implementation pending). Users will only need to cover the gas fees, which are less than $0.01.

### Gamified Experience

1. **Orb Interaction:** Users start by interacting with a floating orb, triggering the Coinbase Smart Wallet window to sign in or create a wallet.
2. **Wallet Information Display:** A floating window shows the user's wallet information, including:
   - Statuses on platforms like Zora, Synthetix, Aerodrome, Nouns, LilNouns, or Farcaster.
   - ENS details, using the preferred profile image (Warpcast or ENS) or none.
   - If the user owns the SupaBald Jesse NFT (owned by Buildathon participants), an Easter egg GIF will play.
   - Verification is done via onchain methods and Airstack for other data checks.
3. **Mint Prompt:** After a brief display of the wallet information, a billboard with the text "MINT" (using the Britney font from the Onchain Summer campaign) appears.
4. **Minting Animation:** Clicking "MINT" initiates a summer-themed background animation. The orb shrinks into a whirlpool, and a random NFT is minted on Base.
5. **Repeat Minting:** Users can mint multiple times, with the orb continuing to shrink after each mint.

## Technologies Used

- **Coinbase Smart Wallet:** Enables seamless wallet creation and management.
- **Coinbase Onchain Verifications:** Verifies user ownership and statuses.
- **OnchainKit:** Facilitates onchain interactions.
- **Airstack:** Verifies user data for enhanced experience.
- **Paymaster and Bundler:** (Upcoming) Will sponsor minting transactions.

## How It Works

Based Summer leverages advanced blockchain technology to create a seamless and engaging onchain social experience. By abstracting complex blockchain interactions, it aims to drive mainstream adoption and enhance virality within the crypto community.
